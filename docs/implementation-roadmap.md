# AgentFlow Implementation Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Backend Setup (4-6 weeks)

### Core Backend & Database Setup
- [ ] Finalize backend technology stack (e.g., NestJS, TypeScript)
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL database instance
- [ ] Define and implement initial Prisma schemas
- [ ] Generate Prisma Client and set up database connection utilities
- [ ] Implement Firebase Authentication
- [ ] Set up real-time communication infrastructure (e.g., WebSockets with Socket.IO)

### API Endpoint Development
- [ ] Design GraphQL API structure (using Apollo Server)
- [ ] Implement AI flow API endpoints
- [ ] Create data validation middleware
- [ ] Set up error handling for API calls

### Initial Frontend Setup (Parallel Task)
- [ ] Basic project structure for frontend (e.g., React, Next.js)
- [ ] Setup state management and API client
## Phase 2: Advanced Features (6-8 weeks)

### Agent Performance Tracking
- [ ] Design performance metrics schema
- [ ] Implement real-time performance logging
- [ ] Create performance dashboard components
- [ ] Develop backend APIs for performance dashboard and analysis algorithms

### Workflow Execution Engine
- [ ] Design workflow state machine
- [ ] Implement workflow execution tracking
- [ ] Create workflow dependency resolution
- [ ] Develop backend APIs for workflow visualization (Frontend will consume this)

### AI Agent Learning
- [ ] Design machine learning model for agent improvement
- [ ] Implement feedback loop mechanism
- [ ] Create agent performance prediction system
- [ ] Develop agent configuration optimization

### Comprehensive Logging
- [ ] Design audit trail schema
- [ ] Implement detailed event logging
- [ ] Create log retention and archival strategy
- [ ] Develop log analysis and reporting tools

## Phase 3: User Management (4-5 weeks)

### Role-Based Access Control
- [ ] Design permission hierarchy
- [ ] Implement role management system
- [ ] Create granular permission controls
- [ ] Develop backend APIs for role assignment (Frontend interfaces will consume this)

### User Profile Management
- [ ] Design user profile schema
- [ ] Implement profile creation and editing
- [ ] Create user preferences system
- [ ] Develop multi-factor authentication

### Team and Organization Support
- [ ] Design multi-tenant architecture
- [ ] Implement organization management
- [ ] Create team collaboration features
- [ ] Develop invitation and onboarding workflows

## Phase 4: Production Readiness (4-6 weeks)

### Error Handling
- [ ] Implement global error handling (Backend: Exception Filters, Frontend: Error Boundaries)
- [ ] Create comprehensive error logging
- [ ] Develop user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Set up error monitoring and alerting

### Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up Jest and React Testing Library
- [ ] Create unit test suites
- [ ] Develop integration test framework
- [ ] Implement end-to-end testing with Cypress

### CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] Configure GitHub Actions
- [ ] Set up automated testing
- [ ] Implement deployment workflows
- [ ] Create staging and production environments

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement code splitting
- [ ] Optimize React rendering (Frontend)
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring (Frontend & Backend)
- [ ] Develop caching strategies (Backend & Frontend)

## Estimated Timeline
- Total Implementation Time: 18-25 weeks
- Parallel development possible
- Regular progress reviews recommended

## Success Criteria
- 90%+ test coverage (align with or clarify difference from other plans)
- Sub-100ms API response times
- Scalable multi-tenant architecture
- Robust AI agent learning capabilities
